# php_exporttoxlsxwithtabs

I've made these scripts to give our users an option to download query results directly into an XLSX file with multiple tabs. I used PHPExcel library in order to format the queries and place them in different tabs.

This can be easily adapted and re-used, you just need to change the results source and formatting.
